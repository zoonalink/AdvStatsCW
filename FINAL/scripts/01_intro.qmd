## Brief {#sec-brief}

The brief is to develop a `classification tool` to classify chemicals into classes.

In addition, the client is interested in understanding whether all variables are *necessary* for achieving optimal out-of-sample classification performance, or if a subset of measurements will suffice.

This report will aim to:

-   explore, analyse and feedback on the provided dataset
-   develop an optimised, classification model
-   comment on whether all variables are required
-   provide recommendations and options, as applicable
