-   To add changes to the staging area: **`git add <file>`** or **`git add .`** (to stage all changes)

-   To see which files are staged and which are not: **`git status`**

-   To unstage changes from the staging area: **`git reset <file>`** or **`git reset`**

-   To commit changes: **`git commit -m "commit message"`**

-   To push changes to the remote repository: **`git push`**

It's important to note that these commands should be used in a specific order:

1.  Add changes to the staging area using **`git add`**

2.  Review the changes using **`git status`**

3.  Stage the changes using **`git commit`**

4.  Commit the changes using **`git commit`**

5.  Push the changes to the remote repository using **`git push`**
