## Brief {#sec-brief}

The brief is to develop a model to effectively classify chemicals into groups using supplied measurements.

The client wants to know if all variables are *necessary* for good out-of-sample classification performance.

This report will:

-   explore and analyse the provided dataset

-   develop an optimised, classification model

-   comment viability of using reduced variable datasets

-   provide recommendations

::: callout-note
Additional analysis is available in the `technical version` of this report, including code and comments.
